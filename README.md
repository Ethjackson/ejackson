## Web Test
Chrome:
Tested if the game played on Chrome. I would make some small changes to make it look btter/ more user friendly.

Microsoft Edge:
Tested if the game played on Microsoft Edge, I would change it so it looks better as all the icons are smaller and a lot of empty space is left.

Internet Explorer:
Tested on Internet Explorer, the navigation would work but the game itself would not work at all with the start button not working.
